The code in this directory contains the code for the benchmark sample called
Day Trader.  This sample was contributed by IBM to the Apache Geronimo project
under the ASF license to further functional and performance testing of Geronimo.  

-----------
|  BUILD  |
-----------
To build Daytrader, you need to have JDK 6 and Maven 3.0.3 or later
installed, which can be found at http://maven.apache.org.
Once installed you can build Daytrader by executing the following command
from the dayTrader root directory (the directory containing this README):

  $ mvn clean install


-------------
|  INSTALL  |
-------------
1. Install proper JDBC driver jars into Geronimo before deployment. For example, to run daytrader with IBM DB2, 
   you need to install DB2 JDBC driver via admin console repository portlet, and name it as following:
    
    <groupId>com.ibm.db2</groupId>
    <artifactId>db2jcc</artifactId>
    <version>8.2</version>
    <type>jar</type>
    
    <groupId>com.ibm.db2</groupId>
    <artifactId>db2jcc_license_cu</artifactId>
    <version>8.2</version>
    <type>jar</type>
    
2. Deploy daytrader to the server:
   a. Via command line, execute these commands from a command prompt:
         $ cd $GERONIMO_HOME/bin
         $ deploy.[bat|sh] deploy $DAYTRADER_HOME/javaee6/assemblies/daytrader-ear/target/daytrader-ear-<version>.ear $DAYTRADER_HOME/javaee6/plans/target/classes/<My plan>
           - where <My plan> is
               For Apache Derby:  daytrader-derby-xa-plan.xml
               For IBM DB2:       daytrader-db2-xa-plan.xml
               For Oracle:        daytrader-oracle-xa-plan.xml
               For MySQL:         daytrader-mysql-xa-plan.xml
               For Informix:      daytrader-informix-xa-plan.xml
               For MS SQL Server: daytrader-informix-xa-plan.xml or daytrader-sqlserver-plan.xml
               For Postgre:       daytrader-postgre-xa-plan.xml

   b. Via admin console, use the admin console to install the application:
     - Under Applications -> Deploy new
     I. Select the EAR file indicated above as your archive.
     II. Select the XML file indicated above as your plan.
     III. Ensure the checkbox is selected to "start app after install".


---------
|  RUN  |
---------
1. Access the dayTrader application at:
         http://<hostname>:<port>/daytrader (This is for traditional servlet and jsp)
         http://<hostname>:<port>/daytrader/index.faces(This is for JSF)
2. Before you begin using Daytrader, theres are a couple setup steps:
   - Re-create daytrader tables
   - Populate the database with a set of fictional users, stocks, prices, etc.
     by selecting:
         'Configuration -> (Re)-populate Trade Database'.
     Note: This may take a minute or two depending on your database server.
   - After populating the database, the Daytrader Configuration options will
     appear.  Just accept the defaults.
3. Now you can begin trading by going to:
         'Trading & Portfolios'   

---------------
|  UNINSTALL  |
---------------
To uninstall Daytrader, issue the following commands:

1. If you installed Daytrader as an application (EAR) using the deployer:
      deploy.[bat|sh] undeploy org.apache.geronimo.daytrader/daytrader/<version>/car
